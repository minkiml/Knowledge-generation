# Hypernetworks
This folder contains codes for creating hypernetwork. The codes can be easily called and used for other frameworks (e.g., subspace network merging and mode connectivity) available in this repository.

## What is Hypernetworks
Hypernetworks are a neural network that generates the weights (and sometimes biases) for another, typically larger (can also be much smaller) neural network called the main network. They are generally used for parameter compression or dynamic and adaptive model generation.
