# About this repo
This repository contains basic experimental and prelimiary codes for various ML concepts and ideas, including neural network merging, hyper networks and meta learning, neural network connectivity . This is essentially a playground for me to explore the ML concepts and test some of isntant ideas to study an currently ongoing project: "generation of knowledge".
