# Short introduction to the repo
This repository contains basic experimental and prelimiary codes for various ML concepts and ideas, including neural network merging (e.g., ref [1]), hyper networks and meta learning (e.g., ref [2] and ref [3]), neural network connectivity (e.g., ref [4]). This is essentially a playground for me to explore the ML concepts and test some of isntant ideas to ultimately study generation of knowledge, i.e., meaningful neural networks.
